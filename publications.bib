  abstract = {Nongeostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite-based Internet is an important part of the future network. One single NGSO satellite has the characteristics of high-speed movement, small coverage area, and short connection time; therefore, the method of multisatellite collaboration is adopted in NGSO satellite-based Internet. Caching is an effective technique to reduce the transmission load and delay, especially for high-value content. However, the traditional caching cannot be applied to the NGSO satellite network directly due to the frequent switching of service satellites. As a result, some high-valued cached data need to be transmitted among satellites, such that an effective routing between the source and destination node needs to be established orderly in the satellite network. This paper proposes a dynamic routing strategy based on multilayer satellite architecture for unicast and multicast scenarios, respectively. For the unicast, a routing strategy based on               Q               -learning is proposed to optimize bandwidth and delay simultaneously, and the effectiveness is verified by the comparison against the traditional routing strategy. For the multicast, an advanced               Q               -learning multicast routing algorithm based on spatial directionality is proposed to optimize the overall transmission success rate and resource cost, and the superiority of the proposed routing strategy is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract      = {Text detection/localization, as an important task in computer vision, has witnessed substantialadvancements in methodology and performance with convolutional neural networks. However, the vastmajority of popular methods use rectangles or quadrangles to describe text regions. These representationshave inherent drawbacks, especially relating to dense adjacent text and loose regional text boundaries,which usually cause difficulty detecting arbitrarily shaped text. In this paper, we propose a novel text regionrepresentation method, with a robust pipeline, which can precisely detect dense adjacent text instances witharbitrary shapes. We consider a text instance to be composed of an adaptive central text region mask anda corresponding expanding ratio between the central text region and the full text region. More specifically,our pipeline generates adaptive central text regions and corresponding expanding ratios with a proposedtraining strategy, followed by a new proposed post-processing algorithm which expands central text regionsto the complete text instance with the corresponding expanding ratios. We demonstrated that our new textregion representation is effective, and that the pipeline can precisely detect closely adjacent text instances ofarbitrary shapes. Experimental results on common datasets demonstrate superior performance o},

  abstract = {Gaining accurate channel state information (CSI) through a low-cost scheme has always been difficult in wireless communication systems. One of the current research directions is to obtain the CSI from the channel knowledge map (CKM) based on the users' location. However, the direct utilization of CSI in CKM is hindered due to the sensitivity of instantaneous CSI to time-varying scattering environments and positioning errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel prediction scheme that combines the CKM with historical user CSI to enhance the beamforming performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, the joint-orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is used to accurately reconstruct the user channel with high precision using a limited number of pilots, and the multi-path components tracking algorithm is employed to extract the common and independent support sets of paths from the estimated channel and the CKM. Lastly, an adaptive and low-complexity predictor is utilized to obtain the future user CSI. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using multiple measured channel datasets, the results indicate a significant improvement in predicting channel cosine similarity compared to directly using the CSI from CKM and existing schemes.},

  abstract      = {Environmental sound classification (ESC) is a challenging problem due to the complexity of sounds. The classification performance is heavily dependent on the effectiveness of representative features extracted from the environmental sounds. However, ESC often suffers from the semantically irrelevant frames and silent frames. In order to deal with this, we employ a frame-level attention model to focus on the semantically relevant frames and salient frames. Specifically, we first propose a convolutional recurrent neural network to learn spectro-temporal features and temporal correlations. Then, we extend our convolutional RNN model with a frame-level attention mechanism to learn discriminative feature representations for ESC. We investigated the classification performance when using different attention scaling function and applying different layers. Experiments were conducted on ESC-50 and ESC-10 datasets. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and our method achieved the state-of-the-art or competitive classification accuracy with lower computational complexity. We also visualized our attention results and observed that the proposed attention mechanism was able to lead the network tofocus on the semantically relevant parts of environmental sounds.},

  abstract   = {Wireless communications for status update are becoming increasingly important, especially for machine-type control applications. Existing work has been mainly focused on Age of Information (AoI) optimizations. In this paper, a status-aware predictive wireless interface design, networking and implementation are presented which aim to minimize the status recovery error of a wireless networked system by leveraging online status model predictions. Two critical issues of predictive status update are addressed: practicality and usefulness. Link-level experiments on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) testbed are conducted and test results show that the proposed design can significantly reduce the number of wireless transmissions while maintaining a low status recovery error. A Status-aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning neTworking solution (SMART) is proposed to dynamically and autonomously control the transmit decisions of devices in an ad hoc network based on their individual statuses. System-level simulations of a multi dense platooning scenario are carried out on a road traffic simulator. Results show that the proposed schemes can greatly improve the platooning control performance in terms of the minimum safe distance between successive vehicles, in comparison with the AoI-optimized status-unaware and communication latency-optimized schemes-this demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed status update schemes in a real-world application.},

  abstract      = {Wireless baseband processing (WBP) serves as an ideal scenario for utilizing vector processing, which excels in managing data-parallel operations due to its parallel structure. However, conventional vector architectures face certain constraints such as limited vector register sizes, reliance on power-of-two vector length multipliers, and vector permutation capabilities tied to specific architectures. To address these challenges, we have introduced an instruction set extension (ISE) based on RISC-V known as unlimited vector processing (UVP). This extension enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of vector computations. UVP employs a novel programming model that supports non-power-of-two register groupings and hardware strip-mining, thus enabling smooth handling of vectors of varying lengths while reducing the software strip-mining burden. Vector instructions are categorized into symmetric and asymmetric classes, complemented by specialized load/store strategies to optimize execution. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of UVP featuring sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, optimized pipelines for symmetric tasks such as fixed-point multiplication and division, and a robust permutation engine for effective asymmetric operations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that UVP significantly enhances performance, achieving up to 3.0\$\textbackslash times\$ and 2.1\$\textbackslash times\$ speedups in matrix multiplication and fast Fourier transform (FFT) tasks, respectively, when measured against lane-based vector architectures. Our synthesized RTL for a 16-lane configuration using SMIC 40nm technology spans 0.94 mm\$\textasciicircum 2\$ and achieves an area efficiency of 21.2 GOPS/mm\$\textasciicircum 2\$.},

According to the information of the time/frequency location where the DMRS is detected, the UE can adjust the decoding area to minimize unnecessary blind decoding attempts.

We propose a hybrid hardware-software scheduling framework for heterogeneous many-core systems, which ensures the software algorithm’s scheduling results while dynamically adjusting task execution at runtime based on hardware status. Task dependencies are analyzed offline using a domain-specific language (DSL) to generate optimized schedules. At runtime, a hardware scheduler performs fast dependency checks and task dispatching. Experimental results show efficient parallel scheduling with minimal overhead, positioning the framework as a practical solution for latency-sensitive applications such as wireless baseband processing.},

  abstract = {Vector instruction set architectures (ISAs) play a critical role in accelerating data-parallel computation, yet mainstream designs—such as the RISC-V “V” Vector Extension (RVV) – still rely on rigid, power-of-two register grouping strategies. These limitations hinder performance when handling ultra-long vectors or non-uniform workloads, as they require extensive strip-mining and careful low-level tuning to maintain efficiency. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose Zoozve, a flexible, strip-mining-free extension to the RISC-V vector ISA. Zoozve introduces an arbitrary register grouping mechanism that enables more precise register utilization and eliminates the need for data slicing across multiple loop iterations. This work presents a full-stack realization of Zoozve, including (1) a hardware-compatible ISA with support for flexible vector lengths and asymmetric instructions, (2) a compiler backend based on LLVM that performs intrinsic splitting, register allocation with live-interval modification, and instruction coalescing, and (3) a hardware proof-of-concept implementation that integrates hazard detection and a register-level element exchange engine. Experimental evaluation using instruction-level simulation shows that Zoozve achieves up to 344.44× speedup in fast Fourier transform (FFT), 76× in dot product, 58.92× in axpy, and 20.41× in 2D convolution compared to RVV, primarily by eliminating strip-mining and improving register reuse. Register transfer level (RTL) synthesis in a 40 nm process shows that Zoozve’s additional hardware logic incurs only 9% area overhead, confirming its feasibility for real-world deployment. Together, these results demonstrate Zoozve’s potential as a scalable and efficient vector processing solution for high-performance computing, machine learning, and signal processing.},
