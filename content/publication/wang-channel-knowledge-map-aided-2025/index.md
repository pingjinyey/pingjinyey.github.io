abstract: Gaining accurate channel state information (CSI) through a low-cost scheme
  has always been difficult in wireless communication systems. One of the current
  research directions is to obtain the CSI from the channel knowledge map (CKM) based
  on the users' location. However, the direct utilization of CSI in CKM is hindered
  due to the sensitivity of instantaneous CSI to time-varying scattering environments
  and positioning errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel prediction
  scheme that combines the CKM with historical user CSI to enhance the beamforming
  performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, the
  joint-orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is used to accurately reconstruct the
  user channel with high precision using a limited number of pilots, and the multi-path
  components tracking algorithm is employed to extract the common and independent
  support sets of paths from the estimated channel and the CKM. Lastly, an adaptive
  and low-complexity predictor is utilized to obtain the future user CSI. The proposed
  scheme has been evaluated using multiple measured channel datasets, the results
  indicate a significant improvement in predicting channel cosine similarity compared
  to directly using the CSI from CKM and existing schemes.
