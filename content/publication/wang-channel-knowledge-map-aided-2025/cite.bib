 abstract = {Gaining accurate channel state information (CSI) through a low-cost scheme has always been difficult in wireless communication systems. One of the current research directions is to obtain the CSI from the channel knowledge map (CKM) based on the users' location. However, the direct utilization of CSI in CKM is hindered due to the sensitivity of instantaneous CSI to time-varying scattering environments and positioning errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel prediction scheme that combines the CKM with historical user CSI to enhance the beamforming performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, the joint-orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is used to accurately reconstruct the user channel with high precision using a limited number of pilots, and the multi-path components tracking algorithm is employed to extract the common and independent support sets of paths from the estimated channel and the CKM. Lastly, an adaptive and low-complexity predictor is utilized to obtain the future user CSI. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using multiple measured channel datasets, the results indicate a significant improvement in predicting channel cosine similarity compared to directly using the CSI from CKM and existing schemes.},
