 abstract = {As heterogeneous many-core systems gain prominence in embedded domains, efficient scheduling mechanisms become increasingly vital. Existing solutions often suffer from trade-offs between real-time responsiveness, parallelism, and programmability. We propose a hybrid hardware-software scheduling framework for heterogeneous many-core systems, which ensures the software algorithm’s scheduling results while dynamically adjusting task execution at runtime based on hardware status. Task dependencies are analyzed offline using a domain-specific language (DSL) to generate optimized schedules. At runtime, a hardware scheduler performs fast dependency checks and task dispatching. Experimental results show efficient parallel scheduling with minimal overhead, positioning the framework as a practical solution for latency-sensitive applications such as wireless baseband processing.},
