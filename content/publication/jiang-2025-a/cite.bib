 abstract = {Vector instruction set architectures (ISAs) play a critical role in accelerating data-parallel computation, yet mainstream designs—such as the RISC-V “V” Vector Extension (RVV) – still rely on rigid, power-of-two register grouping strategies. These limitations hinder performance when handling ultra-long vectors or non-uniform workloads, as they require extensive strip-mining and careful low-level tuning to maintain efficiency. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose Zoozve, a flexible, strip-mining-free extension to the RISC-V vector ISA. Zoozve introduces an arbitrary register grouping mechanism that enables more precise register utilization and eliminates the need for data slicing across multiple loop iterations. This work presents a full-stack realization of Zoozve, including (1) a hardware-compatible ISA with support for flexible vector lengths and asymmetric instructions, (2) a compiler backend based on LLVM that performs intrinsic splitting, register allocation with live-interval modification, and instruction coalescing, and (3) a hardware proof-of-concept implementation that integrates hazard detection and a register-level element exchange engine. Experimental evaluation using instruction-level simulation shows that Zoozve achieves up to 344.44× speedup in fast Fourier transform (FFT), 76× in dot product, 58.92× in axpy, and 20.41× in 2D convolution compared to RVV, primarily by eliminating strip-mining and improving register reuse. Register transfer level (RTL) synthesis in a 40 nm process shows that Zoozve’s additional hardware logic incurs only 9% area overhead, confirming its feasibility for real-world deployment. Together, these results demonstrate Zoozve’s potential as a scalable and efficient vector processing solution for high-performance computing, machine learning, and signal processing.},
