abstract: As heterogeneous many-core systems gain prominence in embedded domains,
  efficient scheduling mechanisms become increasingly vital. Existing solutions often
  suffer from trade-offs between real-time responsiveness, parallelism, and programmability.
  We propose a hybrid hardware-software scheduling framework for heterogeneous many-core
  systems, which ensures the software algorithm’s scheduling results while dynamically
  adjusting task execution at runtime based on hardware status. Task dependencies
  are analyzed offline using a domain-specific language (DSL) to generate optimized
  schedules. At runtime, a hardware scheduler performs fast dependency checks and
  task dispatching. Experimental results show efficient parallel scheduling with minimal
  overhead, positioning the framework as a practical solution for latency-sensitive
  applications such as wireless baseband processing.
