abstract: 'Wireless communications for status update are becoming increasingly important,
  especially for machine-type control applications. Existing work has been mainly
  focused on Age of Information (AoI) optimizations. In this paper, a status-aware
  predictive wireless interface design, networking and implementation are presented
  which aim to minimize the status recovery error of a wireless networked system by
  leveraging online status model predictions. Two critical issues of predictive status
  update are addressed: practicality and usefulness. Link-level experiments on a Software-Defined-Radio
  (SDR) testbed are conducted and test results show that the proposed design can significantly
  reduce the number of wireless transmissions while maintaining a low status recovery
  error. A Status-aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning neTworking solution (SMART)
  is proposed to dynamically and autonomously control the transmit decisions of devices
  in an ad hoc network based on their individual statuses. System-level simulations
  of a multi dense platooning scenario are carried out on a road traffic simulator.
  Results show that the proposed schemes can greatly improve the platooning control
  performance in terms of the minimum safe distance between successive vehicles, in
  comparison with the AoI-optimized status-unaware and communication latency-optimized
  schemes-this demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed status update schemes in
  a real-world application.'
