abstract: Nongeostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite-based Internet is an important part
  of the future network. One single NGSO satellite has the characteristics of high-speed
  movement, small coverage area, and short connection time; therefore, the method
  of multisatellite collaboration is adopted in NGSO satellite-based Internet. Caching
  is an effective technique to reduce the transmission load and delay, especially
  for high-value content. However, the traditional caching cannot be applied to the
  NGSO satellite network directly due to the frequent switching of service satellites.
  As a result, some high-valued cached data need to be transmitted among satellites,
  such that an effective routing between the source and destination node needs to
  be established orderly in the satellite network. This paper proposes a dynamic routing
  strategy based on multilayer satellite architecture for unicast and multicast scenarios,
  respectively. For the unicast, a routing strategy based on               Q               -learning
  is proposed to optimize bandwidth and delay simultaneously, and the effectiveness
  is verified by the comparison against the traditional routing strategy. For the
  multicast, an advanced               Q               -learning multicast routing
  algorithm based on spatial directionality is proposed to optimize the overall transmission
  success rate and resource cost, and the superiority of the proposed routing strategy
  is verified by simulation results.
