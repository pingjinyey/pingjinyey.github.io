 abstract = {Nongeostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite-based Internet is an important part of the future network. One single NGSO satellite has the characteristics of high-speed movement, small coverage area, and short connection time; therefore, the method of multisatellite collaboration is adopted in NGSO satellite-based Internet. Caching is an effective technique to reduce the transmission load and delay, especially for high-value content. However, the traditional caching cannot be applied to the NGSO satellite network directly due to the frequent switching of service satellites. As a result, some high-valued cached data need to be transmitted among satellites, such that an effective routing between the source and destination node needs to be established orderly in the satellite network. This paper proposes a dynamic routing strategy based on multilayer satellite architecture for unicast and multicast scenarios, respectively. For the unicast, a routing strategy based on               Q               -learning is proposed to optimize bandwidth and delay simultaneously, and the effectiveness is verified by the comparison against the traditional routing strategy. For the multicast, an advanced               Q               -learning multicast routing algorithm based on spatial directionality is proposed to optimize the overall transmission success rate and resource cost, and the superiority of the proposed routing strategy is verified by simulation results.},
