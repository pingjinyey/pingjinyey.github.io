abstract: 'Text detection/localization, as an important task in computer vision, has
  witnessed substantialadvancements in methodology and performance with convolutional
  neural networks. However, the vastmajority of popular methods use rectangles or
  quadrangles to describe text regions. These representationshave inherent drawbacks,
  especially relating to dense adjacent text and loose regional text boundaries,which
  usually cause difficulty detecting arbitrarily shaped text. In this paper, we propose
  a novel text regionrepresentation method, with a robust pipeline, which can precisely
  detect dense adjacent text instances witharbitrary shapes. We consider a text instance
  to be composed of an adaptive central text region mask anda corresponding expanding
  ratio between the central text region and the full text region. More specifically,our
  pipeline generates adaptive central text regions and corresponding expanding ratios
  with a proposedtraining strategy, followed by a new proposed post-processing algorithm
  which expands central text regionsto the complete text instance with the corresponding
  expanding ratios. We demonstrated that our new textregion representation is effective,
  and that the pipeline can precisely detect closely adjacent text instances ofarbitrary
  shapes. Experimental results on common datasets demonstrate superior performance'
