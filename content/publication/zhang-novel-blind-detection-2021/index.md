abstract: 'A novel physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) blind detection method
  based on demodulation reference signal (DMRS) detection is proposed for sidelink
  communications in cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X). In the proposed method,
  the user equipment (UE) first performs coherent energy detection on the DMRS positions.
  According to the information of the time/frequency location where the DMRS is detected,
  the UE can adjust the decoding area to minimize unnecessary blind decoding attempts.
  Based on the proposed algorithm and the channel estimation method, a VLSI architecture
  of joint energy detection and channel estimation (JEC) is proposed. Reference implementation
  results for a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA show that our design can reduce hardware complexity
  and energy consumption.'
