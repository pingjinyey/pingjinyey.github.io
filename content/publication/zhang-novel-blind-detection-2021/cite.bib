 abstract = {A novel physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) blind detection method based on demodulation reference signal (DMRS) detection is proposed for sidelink communications in cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X). In the proposed method, the user equipment (UE) first performs coherent energy detection on the DMRS positions. According to the information of the time/frequency location where the DMRS is detected, the UE can adjust the decoding area to minimize unnecessary blind decoding attempts. Based on the proposed algorithm and the channel estimation method, a VLSI architecture of joint energy detection and channel estimation (JEC) is proposed. Reference implementation results for a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA show that our design can reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption.},
