      # 摘要
      text: >
        Addressing the "Edge AI Trilemma" of performance, efficiency, and flexibility, this report introduces a novel **Heterogeneous RISC-V Compute Architecture**.
        
        Our "All-in-One" design integrates a 1D Vector Core and a 2D Systolic Array with shared SRAM, effectively breaking the "Memory Wall" bottleneck. This architecture eliminates high-latency bus traffic, achieving ultra-low power consumption (<1W) while maintaining the flexibility to support rapidly evolving models from CNNs to Transformers.

      title: Communication–AI Fusion and Integrated Compute–Communication Architectures for 6G
      text: |-
        This research area targets AI-native communications in the 6G era by developing deeply integrated communication–AI architectures and unified compute–communication chips. We focus on tightly coupling baseband processing units with NPUs to accelerate intelligent communication tasks such as channel estimation, interference suppression, and resource scheduling, building multi-dimensional architectures with native AI support. For emerging scenarios including low-altitude networks and vehicle–road cooperation, we design unified operator abstractions, compiler toolchains, and runtime systems, enabling communication systems that are co-designed and co-optimized with AI rather than merely AI-enabled.
