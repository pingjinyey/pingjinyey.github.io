      title: Wireless Communication Systems and Dedicated Baseband Processors
      text: |-
        This research area targets emerging vehicular, power, and industry-specific networks, focusing on advanced physical-layer and baseband processing techniques and their corresponding dedicated chips and processor architectures. Our work spans LTE-V/C-V2X vehicular communication, 230 MHz power private network baseband chips, and baseband ASICs for roadside units and industrial IoT. Building on RISC-V and dataflow-driven architectures, we develop domain-specific processors for key communication kernels such as synchronization, channel estimation, and MIMO detection, together with supporting software and toolchains.
