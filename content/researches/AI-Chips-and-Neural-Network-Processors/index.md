      title: AI Chips and Neural Network Processors
      text: |-
        This research area addresses the growing demand for edge intelligence and on-device AI by exploring neural network accelerators, general-purpose NPU architectures, and their compiler and software stacks. Starting from dedicated accelerators for representative CNN models such as ResNet, VGG, and AlexNet, our work extends to general-purpose NPUs supporting both CNNs and Transformers, as well as LLVM-MLIR–based heterogeneous compiler frameworks and runtime systems. We further investigate ultra-low-power design, multi-dimensional compute units, and on-chip networks to enable efficient intelligence on battery-powered and edge devices.
